Sales Insight Dashboard – Power BI Project

Project Description
The Sales Insight Dashboard is a data analytics project developed using Power BI and SQL to analyze and visualize sales performance across products, regions, customers, and time periods.
The objective of this project is to help business stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying revenue trends, top-performing products, customer behavior, and sales growth patterns.
Raw sales data was extracted from a relational database using SQL queries, cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy, and then modeled in Power BI. Interactive dashboards were created with KPIs, charts, and slicers to enable real-time analysis and drill-down insights.

Key Objectives
-Track total sales, profit, and quantity sold
-Identify top and bottom performing products
-Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends
